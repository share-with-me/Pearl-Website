                       <b><u>Short description:</b></u><br>
All major uprisings or indeed revolutions have been the consequence of the
snowballing and mobilization of popular opinion through nukkad nataks. In
the dark medieval times, actors were perhaps the most influential figures in
doing just this. Rousing monologues, raw emotions and gripping plots;
deploy all these and more, and become legendary.<br><br>
<b><u>Long description:</b></u>
Nukkad natak, as the name suggests, nukkad means road-side and natak
means play. It is a form of theatrical performance and presentation in
outdoor public spaces without a specific paying audience. These spaces can
be anywhere, including shopping centers, car parks, recreational reserves
and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there
are large numbers of people. Whatever the reason for choosing the street,
the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional
theatre space.<br>
If you have a desire to inspire people, <b><u>BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus </b></u> 
provides you with a perfect platform to showcase your talent.<br><br>

                        The four vedas were created by Brahma, but the lower cast and ladies were not allowed to study them. So, the myth says, Brahma created the fifth veda called Natyaveda, i.e. the art of drama, which can be studied and practiced by everybody. While creating this natyaveda, Brahma adopted its constituents from four vedas. Recitation was adopted from Rigveda, music and song from Samaveda, histrionics from Yajurveda and sentiments from Atharvaveda. Subordinate vedas called Upavedas were also connected with natyaveda, e.g. Ayurveda was used to show expressions of diseases, their symptoms and certain mental moods etc. as explained by Charaka and Sushruta. Dhanurveda (archery) was made use of in the representation of fights on the stage. Gandharveveda was used in the preliminaries and in the actual performance of drama. Sthapatyaveda (architectural science) was necessary for construction of the playhouse.
Brahma, the Lord of all Creation extracted the requisite elements from the four Vedas and combined them into a fifth Veda and thus gave birth to the art of Drama i.e. Natyaveda. He then handed it to his son, Lord Indra, who in turn passed it to Bharata, a human being, for the Gods cannot indulge in pretence. So, if you believe you have what it takes to please the Gods and keep the audience on the edge of their seat, then come, be a part of the "Odyssey" and honor the "Legends".<br><br><br>
